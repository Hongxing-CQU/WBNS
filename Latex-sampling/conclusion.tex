\section{Conclusion and future work}
We have presented a new multi-class blue noise sampling method by
throwing samples as  Wasserstein barycenter of multi-class density function.
Our approach introduces weighted parameters to explicitly adjust point distributions of each individual class and the combined classes.
By adjusting the discrete density value at samples,
we are able to generate multi-class samples with different size.
Our approach can also be directly applied for multi-class sampling on point set surface.
Moreover, our approach is easy to implement in parallel which ensure the efficiency of computations.
We have also performed applications on object placement and color stippling.

In the future,
an interesting problem is to study how to extend our approach for generating point distributions with multi-given target characteristics.
Another possible direction is to study how to improve the efficiency for large databases.
