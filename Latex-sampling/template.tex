\begin{abstract}
Sampling is a core component for many applications such as imaging,
rendering, geometry processing and visualization. Prior research
has mainly focused on blue noise sampling with a single
class of samples. Limited research has been done on multi-class
sampling; especially, multi-class blue noise sampling is still a challenging problem
when the density distribution of every class is nonuniform and different from each
other. In this paper, we present a Wasserstein blue
noise sampling algorithm for multi-class sampling by throwing samples
as Wasserstein barycenter of multiple density distributions. We
employ a more general representation of optimal transport problem
to break the partition necessary in other optimal sampling.
Moreover, adaptive blue noise distribution property for every
individual class is guaranteed, as well as their combined class.
Furthermore, the efficiency of sampling is improved by applying
Wasserstein distance with entropic constraints. Our method can
be applied to multi-class sampling on the point set surface. We also
demonstrate applications in object distribution and color stippling.
